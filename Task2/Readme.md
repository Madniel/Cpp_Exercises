exercise 1
Calculate the value of pi, with the number of iterations and approximation method chosen by the user. Implement the Leibniz and Wallis methods

exercise 2
Write the program, which will show all ASCII coded characters (1-255, show both code and character). After every 40 codes, each in separate line, the program should stop and wait for a user to press any key (use modulo operation: %).

exercise 3
Factorial of a n, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n: n!=1*2*...*(n-1)*n. The value of 0! is 1. Factorial is defined for non-negative integer.
- Write the program, which will calculate factorial of the number provided by a user,
- handle the situation when n<0 and n=0,
- determine maximal n for which program will provide correct result (int type will not overflow).

exercise 4
Write the menu program, which will integrate previous 3 programs and a user will be able to choose from a menu, which option he or she wants to perform:

Choose an option:
1 – Exercise 1
2 – Exercise 2
3 – Exercise 3
x – Exit
