Citizen Jan Kowalski was born in Poznan 30 years ago. His mother, mrs Jadwiga (of a Kazmierczak), was 20 years old then and his father 25 years old.

Kowalski Jan till 12.10.2015 lived approximately 11155 days.
His father is 1.83 times older than him and mother 1.67 times.
It is an old family, because together they have 135 years.

Calculate an exact number of days lived knowing that leap year is divisible by 4 and if divisible by 100 has to be also divisible by 400 (e.g., 1900 is not a leap year).
