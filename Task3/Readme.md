exercise 16
Write the program, which will show all ASCII coded characters (1-255, show both code and character). After every 40 codes, each in separate line, the program should stop and wait for a user to press any key (use modulo operation: %).


exercise 17
Factorial of a n, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n: n!=1*2*...*(n-1)*n. The value of 0! is 1. Factorial is defined for non-negative integer.
- Write the program, which will calculate factorial of the number provided by a user,
- handle the situation when n<0 and n=0,
- determine maximal n for which program will provide correct result (int type will not overflow).

exercise 18
Write the program which will read text from user input, will display it in backward order and will determine if it is a palindrome. To determine the string length use strlen function.

exercise 22
Write the program which will read any text provided by a user and will display it with uppercase letters changed to lowercase letters and vice versa.

exercise 23
Write the program which will calculate sum:

of n first elements. The n should be provided by a user. Multiply the result by 4 and display it. What number is it?

exercise 25
Write the program that reads 10 numbers and sorts them by value. The bubble sort is the simplest way to do that.

exercise 26
Write a program that displays all the prime numbers less than 100.
