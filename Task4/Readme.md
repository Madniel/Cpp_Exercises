Exercise 1
Create a function that computes the geometric mean [link] of 3 provided numbers.
Exercise 2
Create a function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) [wiki] of two provided numbers.
Exercise 3
Create a function that computes the greatest common divisor of 3 provided numbers
Exercise 4
Create a function that cipher the provided text with Caesar cipher [wiki]. Add an additional, optional parameter to the function that specifies the shift used in the cipher (default equal to 3). Verify the solution using the same function to cipher and decipher provided text. Please consider only small letters, capital letters, and spaces. Small letters should be ciphered as small letters, whereas capital letters as capital letters.
Exercise 5
Create a function that rounds the provided number according to mathematical rules (if more than 0.5 we round up, otherwise we round down). Use passing by reference.
Exercise 6
Create a function isPrime(int n) that returns true or false. Use it to find all prime numbers that are smaller than 100
Exercise 7
Create a function that computes the area and volume of a sphere with given radius r. Return values by reference
Exercise 8
Create a function that computes the harmonic mean [link] of values stored in an array. The function takes two parameters - an array of unrestricted size and array size stored as an integer
